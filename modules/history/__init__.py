"""History module for JuicyFox (PlanÂ A)

This package exposes a single `router` object for use with aiogram
Dispatcher.  It is intentionally lightweight: all logic lives in
``handlers.py``.  Importing this package will attempt to import
``handlers.router`` and expose it via ``__all__``.  If the import
fails (for example, if the optional history feature is disabled or
missing dependencies), it will be silently ignored so that the rest
of the bot can continue to function.
