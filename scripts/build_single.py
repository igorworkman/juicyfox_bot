"""Placeholder for building a monolithic JuicyFox bot (Plan A).

This script is intended to bundle the modular JuicyFox source tree
into a single Python file for deployment on platforms that do not
support multi‑file applications.  As of Plan A, the monolithic
builder is optional and not fully implemented.

Running this script currently prints a message indicating that the
feature is not yet implemented.  Refer to the documentation for
instructions on deploying the bot using the modular structure or
building manually.
